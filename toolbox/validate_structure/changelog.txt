

2.1
-------
- Added the ability to add "files" entry in "dir". Each directory found
matching the regex will be searched for ALL the files listed in "files".
"files" is a list which may contain \\0 \\1 etc, this corresponds to groups
in the directory regex. 

For example:
"dir": {
    "path": "ba(.+)/fo(.+)",
    "files": [
        "ta\\1.txt"
    ]
}

This will look in bar/foo for tao.txt


2.2
-------
- Added the ability to add "only_folders" entry in "dir". Each directory found
matching the regex will be checked that it contains only folders, no files.

- Changed implementation: Sections of "dir" ("files", "only_folders") are implemented as classes
 (actually subclasses of "Directory"). Each of these classes implement validate(directories), 
 so that it receives the list of the directories matched. 

 3.0
 ------
 - Removed use of classes, only functions
 - There are now only "dir" and "file". These have a "rules" field which contain rules regarding the file/dir.
 - Added typehints

 3.1 (28/4/22)
 ---------
 - Validating the `rules.json` file using json schema
 - Using the Path class instead of os.path where possible
 - Adding `matching_file` rule to `file`
