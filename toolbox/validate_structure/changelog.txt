-------
- Added the ability to add "files" entry in "dir". Each directory found
matching the regex will be searched for ALL the files listed in "files".
"files" is a list which may contain \\0 \\1 etc, this corresponds to groups
in the directory regex. 

For example:
"dir": {
    "path": "ba(.+)/fo(.+)",
    "files": [
        "ta\\1.txt"
    ]
}

This will look in bar/foo for tao.txt
